# Given a tree with n nodes, rooted at node 0 (nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1), with values assigned to nodes such that values[i] denotes the  value of node i, find the maximal sum of values along any path starting at some nde u and going oly down the tree. In other words, only consider path u1, u2, u3 ..., uk where each node ui is a child of node ui-1 for 1<1k. For example, given the following three (labeled node number/value):
# 0/4   1/2   2/5   3/10
# 4/7   5/1   6/2   7/3
# 8/2   9/6   10/9  11/2
